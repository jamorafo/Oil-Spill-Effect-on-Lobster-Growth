# Oil-Spill-Effect-on-Lobster-Growth

This repository contains the ecological modeling of lobster populations post-oil spill. It integrates data analysis with R and simulation using NetLogo.

## Contents
- `Hatching rate.R`: R script for analyzing lobster egg hatching rates.
- `lobsters.nlogo`: NetLogo model for simulating population dynamics.
- `Oil concentration.R`: Script for calculating oil concentration effects on lobsters.
- `SST plot.R`: Visualization of Sea Surface Temperature's (SST) influence on lobster populations.

## Usage
Each R script contains commented sections for ease of use. The `.nlogo` file can be run with NetLogo 6.2 or higher.

## Contributing
Contributions to the modeling and analysis are welcome. Please submit a pull request or open an issue for discussion.
